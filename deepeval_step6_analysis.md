# DeepEval - Step 6 Support Analysis

## Summary Table
| Process | Support Level | Evidence |
|---------|--------------|----------|
| S6P1 | 1 | Basic file output only, no artifact packaging |
| S6P2 | 2 | Text reports and web dashboard via Confident AI |
| S6P3 | 2 | Web dashboard through Confident AI platform |
| S6P4 | 1 | Minimal config saving, no environment capture |
| S6P5 | 2 | CI/CD support via pytest, Confident AI integration |

## Detailed Analysis

### S6P1: Package evaluation artifacts
**Rating:** 1
**Evidence:**
- Basic file output through `DisplayConfig.file_output_dir` parameter in `/deepeval/evaluate/configs.py:26`
- Simple text log files generated via `write_test_result_to_file()` function in `/deepeval/evaluate/utils.py:416-519`
- No artifact compression, versioning, or metadata tracking capabilities found
- Trace data exported through OpenTelemetry exporter in `/deepeval/tracing/otel/exporter.py`, but limited packaging
**Limitations:**
- Only supports basic log file output in text format
- No bundling of logs, traces, and model outputs into packages
- No artifact versioning or metadata management
- No compression or organized packaging utilities

### S6P2: Generate standardized reports
**Rating:** 2
**Evidence:**
- Text-based reports generated to log files with metrics summary and test case details
- Dataset export functionality supports JSON, CSV, and JSONL formats via `save_as()` method in `/deepeval/dataset/dataset.py:932-938`
- Web dashboard available through Confident AI platform integration (`/deepeval/confident/api.py`)
- Support for different display options: "all", "failing", "passing" via `TestRunResultDisplay` enum
- Pass rate aggregation functionality in `aggregate_metric_pass_rates()` function
- Example integration in `/examples/rag_evaluation/rag_evaluation_with_qdrant.py` shows dashboard publishing
**Limitations:**
- No native HTML/PDF report generation capabilities
- Limited to dataset export, not comprehensive evaluation reports
- No compliance documentation or audit report features
- No leaderboard generation outside of web platform

### S6P3: Create interactive visualizations and exploratory tools
**Rating:** 2
**Evidence:**
- Web-based dashboard through Confident AI platform with interactive capabilities
- Example in Qdrant RAG evaluation shows dashboard visualization: "You can then find results of the evaluation in the Confident AI dashboard"
- Server functionality for web interface in `/deepeval/cli/server.py`
- Rich console output for formatted display using Rich library (dependency in `pyproject.toml`)
**Limitations:**
- No direct support for plotly, bokeh, or other visualization libraries
- Interactive features only available through external Confident AI platform
- No built-in exploration or filtering tools in the framework itself
- Limited local visualization capabilities

### S6P4: Archive for reproducibility
**Rating:** 1
**Evidence:**
- Basic configuration persistence through `--save` flag mentioned in documentation
- Test run caching functionality in `/deepeval/test_run/cache.py`
- Settings management in `/deepeval/config/settings.py` with dotenv support
- Hyperparameters tracking in `/deepeval/test_run/hyperparameters.py`
**Limitations:**
- No complete configuration serialization for reproducibility
- No environment specification capture (requirements, containers)
- No versioning system for configurations
- No checksumming capabilities for reproducibility verification

### S6P5: Publish to appropriate channels
**Rating:** 2
**Evidence:**
- Native CI/CD integration through pytest: "deepeval test run" command for CI/CD pipelines
- Documentation includes CI/CD examples in `/docs/docs/evaluation-unit-testing.mdx`
- Confident AI platform integration for publishing results to web dashboard
- OpenTelemetry tracing export capabilities for publishing trace data
- GitHub Actions mentioned in documentation for CI/CD workflows
**Limitations:**
- No direct MLOps platform integrations (MLflow, W&B, Neptune not found in codebase)
- No model registry support
- Limited to Confident AI platform for result publishing
- No webhook or API publishing mechanisms outside of the platform
