# deepeval - Step 5 Support Analysis

## Summary Table
| Process | Support Level | Evidence |
|---------|--------------|----------|
| S5P1 | 1 | Basic aggregation (pass rates only), no advanced statistics |
| S5P2 | 0 | No stratified analysis capabilities found |
| S5P3 | 0 | No diagnostic visualization capabilities in core framework |
| S5P4 | 1 | Minimal performance tracking via completion time, no tradeoff analysis |
| S5P5 | 2 | Model comparison via Arena framework and platform integration |

## Detailed Analysis

### S5P1: Compute aggregate statistics
**Rating:** 1
**Evidence:**
- `/home/runner/work/deepeval/deepeval/deepeval/evaluate/utils.py` contains `aggregate_metric_pass_rates()` function
- `/home/runner/work/deepeval/deepeval/deepeval/integrations/hugging_face/callback.py` has basic aggregation with `_aggregate_scores()` supporting avg, max, min
- Feature comparison table mentions "Metric score analysis" with "Score distributions, mean, median, standard deviation, etc." but this appears to be Confident AI platform feature
- `/home/runner/work/deepeval/deepeval/deepeval/models/_summac_model.py` shows some aggregation methods (mean, min, max) in model internals

**Limitations:**
- Only basic pass rate aggregation available in core framework
- No built-in statistical functions for percentiles, variance, or robust statistics
- Advanced statistical analysis requires Confident AI platform subscription
- No utilities for handling missing data or outliers in the core framework
- Weighted aggregation is limited to specific model implementations

### S5P2: Perform stratified analysis
**Rating:** 0
**Evidence:**
- No evidence of stratified analysis capabilities found in the codebase search
- No data slicing utilities based on metadata attributes
- No group-by operations or multi-dimensional stratification tools
- No built-in fairness or bias analysis tools

**Limitations:**
- Framework lacks any stratified analysis capabilities
- No support for demographic, domain, or difficulty-based slicing
- Users must implement stratification entirely outside the framework
- No cross-tabulation functionality

### S5P3: Generate diagnostic visualizations
**Rating:** 0
**Evidence:**
- Search for visualization libraries (matplotlib, plotly, seaborn) returned no results in core framework
- No plotting or chart generation capabilities found
- No confusion matrix, ROC curve, or PR curve generation
- Feature comparison table mentions "Metric validation" with "confusion matrices, etc." but this is platform-only

**Limitations:**
- No built-in visualization capabilities
- Diagnostic charts only available through Confident AI platform
- No export capabilities for visualizations
- Users must implement all plotting functionality externally

### S5P4: Analyze performance-quality tradeoffs and failure patterns
**Rating:** 1
**Evidence:**
- `/home/runner/work/deepeval/deepeval/deepeval/test_case/llm_test_case.py` includes `completion_time` field for basic performance tracking
- `/home/runner/work/deepeval/deepeval/deepeval/evaluate/utils.py` shows basic error handling and success/failure tracking
- No latency vs accuracy curve generation found
- No systematic failure pattern detection capabilities

**Limitations:**
- Only basic performance metrics (completion time) available
- No tradeoff analysis tools
- No automated failure pattern detection
- No root cause analysis capabilities
- No bias detection for performance patterns

### S5P5: Rank and compare models against baselines
**Rating:** 2
**Evidence:**
- `/home/runner/work/deepeval/deepeval/deepeval/evaluate/compare.py` provides Arena-based model comparison
- `compare()` function with winner counting and aggregation via `Counter()` from collections
- Feature comparison table mentions "A|B regression testing" and "Prompts and models experimentation"
- Arena test cases support for head-to-head comparisons
- Platform integration for leaderboards mentioned in feature comparison

**Limitations:**
- No statistical significance testing in core framework
- Leaderboard generation requires platform integration
- Limited to pairwise Arena comparisons
- No built-in baseline tracking or relative improvement metrics
- Advanced comparison features require Confident AI platform

## Key Findings

1. **Platform Dependency**: Most advanced analysis capabilities are available only through the Confident AI platform, not in the open-source framework
2. **Basic Core Features**: The core framework provides minimal analysis capabilities, mostly limited to pass rates and simple aggregations
3. **Arena Comparison**: The strongest analysis feature is the Arena-based model comparison system
4. **Missing Statistical Tools**: No advanced statistical analysis, visualization, or stratification capabilities in the core framework
5. **Performance Tracking**: Limited to basic metrics like completion time, with no sophisticated performance analysis

## Overall Assessment

deepeval provides **Basic Support (1pt)** for Step 5 ANALYZE processes overall. While it has some analysis capabilities, most advanced features require the paid Confident AI platform. The open-source framework is primarily focused on evaluation execution rather than comprehensive result analysis. Users requiring sophisticated analysis capabilities would need to implement custom solutions or subscribe to the platform service.
